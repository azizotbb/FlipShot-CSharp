# 🔥 FlipShot - The Screenshot Flipper 9000

Because regular screenshots are SO last century! 📸💫

## 🎪 What This Magical Tool Does

- 📸 **Screenshot Capture** - Steals your screen faster than you can say "cheese!"
- 🎨 **Grayscale Magic** - Removes all colors because who needs rainbows anyway?
- 🔄 **The Great Flip** - Your screen does a backflip (horizontally, because we're not wizards)
- 💾 **Auto-Save Sorcery** - Saves itself like it has commitment issues

## 🚀 How to Unleash the Beast

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then sit back and watch your computer have an identity crisis! 🤖💭
